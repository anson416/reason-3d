You are given four images of the same object from different angles. The name of the object is {name}. Your job is to tell me in what image the the object is shown from the front and you can clearly see and identify it. If the object is radially symmetrical regarding their primary structure,
pick an image where the object looks natural. In order to tell me which image you chose, give me as output a number between 1 and 4, which serves as the index for the list of images I provide.
